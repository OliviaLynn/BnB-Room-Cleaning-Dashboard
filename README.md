Brief demo of an interactive dashboard for monitoring and improving BnB room cleanliness, as well as recognizing and incentivizing excellent performances by our lovely cleaners.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get this dashboard up and running and fully interactive on your own machine.

### Prerequisites

#### d3js (5.12.0)
The minified version is included in this git, so no need to do anything about this.

### Running
From your shell, type:
```shell
$ cd <whereever\you\put\this\directory>
$ python -m http.server 8000
```
Then open a new Chrome window and visit "localhost:8000" using the URL bar at the top. 

*(You can technically use any browser you like, but this demo was made using Chrome and I haven't gone through the layout and spacing changes needed for other browsers yet.)*

## Data

The included data have been altered to preserve confidentiality and are used for sample purposes only. (The cleaners' names, for example, are now names of players on the [US Women's soccer team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_women%27s_national_soccer_team) :runner:)
