An interactive dashboard for monitoring and improving BnB room cleanliness, as well as incentivizing and applauding excellent performances by our lovely cleaners.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get this dashboard up and running and fully interactive on your own machine.

### Prerequisites

#### d3js (5.12.0)
The minified version is included in this git, so no need to do anything about this.

### Running
From your shell, type:
```shell
$ cd <whereever\you\put\this\directory>
$ python -m http.server 8000
```
Then open a new Chrome window and visit "localhost:8000" using the URL bar at the top. 

*(You can technically use any browser you like, but this demo was made using Chrome and I haven't gone through the layout and spacing changes needed for other browsers yet.)*
